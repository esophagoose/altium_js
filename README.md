# schdoc.js

schdoc.js is a library to render Altium Schematic Documents. It's based on 
Graham Sutherland's version (altium.js) but has been expanded to handle many more features of SchDocs and renders as an SVG for the ability to zoom and manipulate as needed.

## Known issues

This is still a work-in-progress. Any bugs found please feel free to open a PR or file a bug ticket. Thank you!
